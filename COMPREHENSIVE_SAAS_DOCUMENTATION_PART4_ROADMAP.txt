- Filtering: Use query parameters
- Authentication: Bearer token or API key

WEBHOOK DESIGN:
- POST to client-provided URL
- Include signature for verification (HMAC-SHA256)
- Retry on failure (exponential backoff)
- Idempotent (safe to receive duplicate)
- Include timestamp
- JSON payload

SECURITY:
- HTTPS only
- API key authentication
- Rate limiting (100 requests/15 minutes)
- Input validation
- Output sanitization
- CORS configuration

DOCUMENTATION:
- OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- Interactive API docs
- Code examples in multiple languages
- Postman collection provided
- Webhook payload examples

================================================================================
5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
================================================================================

5.1 CURRENT PERFORMANCE METRICS
--------------------------------

Response Times (Development):
- GET /api/orders: ~200ms
- POST /api/orders: ~300ms
- GET /api/patients: ~150ms
- GET /health: ~10ms

Page Load Times:
- Initial load: ~2-3 seconds
- Dashboard: ~1-2 seconds
- Order details: ~800ms

Database Query Performance:
- Simple selects: <50ms
- Complex joins: 100-200ms
- Aggregations: 200-500ms

Bottlenecks Identified:
- Large order lists without pagination
- N+1 queries in some endpoints
- No caching implemented
- Unoptimized images
- Large bundle sizes

5.2 OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
----------------------------

DATABASE OPTIMIZATION
---------------------

Indexing Strategy:
✓ Primary keys (auto-indexed)
✓ Foreign keys (indexed)
✓ Common filter fields (company_id, status)
✓ Date ranges (created_at, updated_at)
⚠️ Missing: Full-text search indexes

Query Optimization:
- Use SELECT only needed columns
- Add LIMIT to large result sets
- Use EXISTS instead of COUNT where possible
- Avoid SELECT * in production
- Use prepared statements (Drizzle handles this)

Connection Pooling:
```typescript
// Configure in DATABASE_URL
postgresql://user:pass@host/db?pool_size=20&max_idle=5
```

Read Replicas (Future):
- Primary for writes
- Replicas for read-heavy queries (analytics)
- Reduce load on primary

CACHING STRATEGY
----------------

Redis Integration:
```typescript
import Redis from 'ioredis';
const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

// Cache user session
await redis.set(`user:${userId}`, JSON.stringify(user), 'EX', 3600);

// Cache frequent queries
await redis.set(`orders:${companyId}`, JSON.stringify(orders), 'EX', 300);
```

Cache Layers:
1. Browser cache (static assets)
2. CDN cache (images, CSS, JS)
3. Application cache (Redis)
4. Database query cache

Cache Invalidation:
- Time-based (TTL)
- Event-based (on data change)
- Manual (admin action)

What to Cache:
- User sessions (already cached)
- Product catalog (rarely changes)
- Supplier list (rarely changes)
- Dashboard metrics (5-minute TTL)
- Static content (long TTL)

What NOT to Cache:
- Real-time order status
- Current inventory levels
- User-specific data (security risk)
- Transactional data

FRONTEND OPTIMIZATION
---------------------

Code Splitting:

```bash
# Analyze bundle
npm run build
# Check dist/ folder sizes
```

Strategies:
- Tree shaking (remove unused code)
- Minimize dependencies
- Use production builds
- Enable compression (gzip/brotli)

React Performance:
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- useMemo for expensive calculations
- useCallback for event handlers
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Debounce search inputs

API OPTIMIZATION
----------------

Pagination:
```typescript
// Always paginate large lists
GET /api/orders?limit=20&offset=0
```

Field Selection:
```typescript
// Allow clients to select fields
GET /api/orders?fields=id,status,patientName
```

Batch Requests:
```typescript
// Allow multiple operations in one request
POST /api/batch
{
  "requests": [
    { "method": "GET", "url": "/orders/1" },
    { "method": "GET", "url": "/patients/2" }
  ]
}
```

GraphQL (Future):
- Request exactly what you need
- Reduce over-fetching
- Single endpoint
- Strong typing

CDN & ASSET DELIVERY
--------------------

CloudFront/Cloudflare:

- Sentry
- Custom metrics

Metrics to Track:
- Response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates
- Request volume
- Database query times
- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Active users

Logging:
- Structured logging (JSON)
- Log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Centralized logging (ELK stack, Datadog)
- Log rotation
- PII redaction

Alerts:
- Response time > 1s
- Error rate > 1%
- Database connections exhausted
- Memory usage > 80%
- Disk space < 20%

5.4 LOAD TESTING
----------------

Tools:
- k6 (modern, developer-friendly)
- Apache JMeter
- Artillery
- Locust

Test Scenarios:
1. Normal load (expected traffic)
2. Peak load (2x normal)
3. Stress test (find breaking point)
4. Spike test (sudden traffic surge)
5. Soak test (sustained load for hours)

Example k6 Test:
```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  vus: 100, // 100 virtual users
  duration: '5m',
};

export default function () {
  let response = http.get('https://api.ils.com/orders');
  check(response, { 'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200 });
  sleep(1);
}
```

================================================================================
6. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
================================================================================

6.1 SECURITY BEST PRACTICES (IMPLEMENTED)
------------------------------------------

AUTHENTICATION:
✅ bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds)
✅ Session-based authentication
✅ HTTP-only cookies
✅ Secure cookies in production
✅ Session expiration
✅ Password minimum length (12 characters)

AUTHORIZATION:
✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
✅ isAuthenticated middleware on all protected routes
✅ Role checks where appropriate
✅ Company-scoped data access (multi-tenancy)

INPUT VALIDATION:
✅ Zod schema validation on all inputs
✅ Type checking (TypeScript)
✅ Email normalization
✅ SQL injection prevention (Drizzle ORM parameterized queries)

SECURITY HEADERS:
⚠️ Needs improvement - Add helmet.js:
```typescript
import helmet from 'helmet';
app.use(helmet());
```

Headers to set:
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-XSS-Protection

CORS:
✅ Configured for specific origin
✅ Credentials enabled
⚠️ Should restrict to production domain

6.2 VULNERABILITY MITIGATION
-----------------------------

SQL INJECTION:
Protection: Drizzle ORM with parameterized queries
Status: ✅ PROTECTED

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):
Protection: React automatically escapes output
Additional: Content-Security-Policy header
Status: ✅ MOSTLY PROTECTED

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):
Protection: SameSite cookies
Additional: CSRF tokens (not implemented)
Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL PROTECTION

Clickjacking:
Protection: X-Frame-Options header
Status: ⚠️ NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

File Upload Vulnerabilities:
Protection: File type validation, size limits
Issues: Files stored on server filesystem
Improvement: Move to S3, virus scanning
Status: ⚠️ BASIC PROTECTION

Rate Limiting:
Status: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
Recommendation: Add express-rate-limit
```typescript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100
});

app.use('/api/', limiter);
```

   The technology stack is modern and the codebase is well-structured.

2. HONEST ASSESSMENT:
   Documentation claims extensive AI capabilities that are not yet functional.
   The AI services are written but not connected to API endpoints. This gap
   should be addressed either by completing the integration or updating the
   documentation to reflect reality.

3. STRENGTHS:
   - Solid core business functionality
   - Modern, intuitive UI/UX
   - Type-safe codebase (TypeScript)
   - Multi-tenant architecture (backend complete)
   - Comprehensive database schema
   - Good security practices

4. OPPORTUNITIES:
   - Complete AI feature integration (10-13 weeks)
   - Fully implement multi-tenant self-service
   - Add mobile applications
   - Expand integrations (LIMS, EMR, etc.)
   - Migrate to microservices architecture
   - Enhance analytics and reporting

5. RECOMMENDATION:
   Market the system based on what's functional today while building toward
   the AI-powered vision. Set realistic timelines for advanced features and
   communicate clearly with stakeholders about the roadmap.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review and update marketing materials to match reality
2. Prioritize AI integration if that's a key differentiator
3. Complete multi-tenant onboarding automation
4. Implement missing core features (equipment management, SMS, etc.)
5. Plan microservices migration if scaling is priority
6. Conduct thorough security audit before production launch

The ILS platform has strong foundations and significant potential. With focused
effort on completing the AI integration and refining the multi-tenant experience,
it can become a leading solution in the optical industry.
