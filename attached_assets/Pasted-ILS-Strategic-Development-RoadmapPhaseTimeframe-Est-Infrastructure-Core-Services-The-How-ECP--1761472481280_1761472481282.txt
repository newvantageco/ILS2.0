• Internal QA Failure Logging module• (On Hold - Focus on internal QA)Phase 4: Full Automation & InnovationMonth 13+• Refine APIs for 2-way machine control
• Scalable R&D "sandbox" environment• Feature Add: "Pilot Product" ordering (for approved ECPs)• LAUNCH: Engineering Hub v2.0
• R&D Pilot Module (tracks experimental jobs)
• Machine Integration (2-Way): Push coating recipes, surfacing params• LAUNCH: Vendor Connect v2.0
• Full SNCR Workflow (links internal QA failures to supplier material batches)Summary of First 90 Days (Phase 0)As your plan states, the immediate priority is Phase 0. My development squad and I will focus exclusively on:Workshops & Design: Finalizing the MVP backlog and producing high-fidelity, clickable prototypes for ECP and Lab portals.Infrastructure: Building the secure, scalable cloud environment on AWS/GCP.Database & API: Implementing the foundational database schema and the core authentication and order-submission API.This sets the stage for a rapid and successful Phase 1 (MVP) launch in the following quarter.
